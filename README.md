# MyPath
Command line program to map and route an OpenStreetMap XML file

Pass the program the two nodes you want to travel between, the OSM XML file name, and optionally the output name of the image.
mypath.py will then compute using a bfs algorithm the shortest path between the nodes and draw the map with the route colored.
